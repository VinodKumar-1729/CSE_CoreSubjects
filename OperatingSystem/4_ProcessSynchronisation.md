### Process Synchronization
Process synchronization ensures that multiple processes can operate safely when accessing shared resources, preventing data inconsistencies and race conditions. Below are detailed notes on key topics related to process synchronization:

---

#### Critical Section Problem
- **Critical Section**: A part of the program where shared resources are accessed.
- **Conditions for Solution** (Mutual Exclusion, Progress, and Bounded Waiting):
  - **Mutual Exclusion**: Only one process can execute in the critical section at a time.
  - **Progress**: If no process is in the critical section, a process outside it should not prevent others from entering.
  - **Bounded Waiting**: A bound must exist on the number of times other processes can enter their critical sections before a waiting process gets a turn.

### Hardware-Based Solutions
#### Test-And-Set (TAS)
- A hardware instruction used to implement mutual exclusion.
- **Mechanism**:
  1. Atomically sets a lock variable and returns its old value.
  2. If the old value is 0, the process enters the critical section.
- **Pseudocode**:
  ```
  do {
      while (TestAndSet(lock));  // Busy wait
      critical section
      lock = 0;                // Exit section
      remainder section
  } while (true);
  ```
- **Disadvantages**: May lead to busy waiting.

#### Compare-And-Swap (CAS)
- Another atomic hardware instruction for synchronization.
- **Mechanism**:
  1. Compares the value at a memory location with a given value.
  2. If equal, swaps the memory location with a new value.
- **Pseudocode**:
  ```
  boolean CompareAndSwap(int *addr, int expected, int new) {
      if (*addr == expected) {
          *addr = new;
          return true;
      }
      return false;
  }
  ```
- **Advantages**: Useful for implementing lock-free data structures.

### Software-Based Solutions
#### Petersonâ€™s Algorithm
- A classic software solution for two-process synchronization.
- **Mechanism**:
  1. Uses two shared variables: `flag[]` (indicates intent to enter) and `turn` (decides whose turn it is).
  2. Ensures mutual exclusion and bounded waiting.
- **Pseudocode**:
  ```
  flag[i] = true;
  turn = j;
  while (flag[j] && turn == j);
  critical section
  flag[i] = false;
  remainder section
  ```
- **Disadvantages**: Limited to two processes; not scalable.

### Semaphores
#### Binary Semaphores
- Can have only two values: 0 or 1.
- **Usage**: Implement mutual exclusion.
- **Pseudocode**:
  ```
  wait(S):
      while (S <= 0);
      S--;

  signal(S):
      S++;
  ```

#### Counting Semaphores
- Used to control access to a resource with a finite number of instances.
- **Example**: Resource pool management.
- **Pseudocode**:
  ```
  wait(S):
      while (S <= 0);
      S--;

  signal(S):
      S++;
  ```

### Mutexes
- A mutual exclusion mechanism similar to binary semaphores but provides ownership.
- **Features**:
  - Only the process that locks the mutex can unlock it.
  - Prevents priority inversion by using protocols like priority inheritance.

---

### Monitors
- High-level synchronization construct that combines mutual exclusion with condition variables.
- **Features**:
  - Encapsulates shared variables and procedures.
  - Provides `wait()` and `signal()` operations for condition synchronization.
- **Example in Pseudocode**:
  ```
  monitor Example {
      int resource;
      condition cond;

      procedure access() {
          if (resource == 0)
              wait(cond);
          resource--;
      }

      procedure release() {
          resource++;
          signal(cond);
      }
  }
  ```

### Classical Synchronization Problems
#### Producer-Consumer Problem
- **Description**: Producers generate items and place them in a buffer; consumers remove items from the buffer.
- **Solution**:
  - Use semaphores for mutual exclusion and synchronization.
  - **Pseudocode**:
    ```
    semaphore mutex = 1;
    semaphore full = 0;
    semaphore empty = N; // Buffer size

    Producer:
      wait(empty);
      wait(mutex);
      add item to buffer;
      signal(mutex);
      signal(full);

    Consumer:
      wait(full);
      wait(mutex);
      remove item from buffer;
      signal(mutex);
      signal(empty);
    ```

#### Dining Philosophers Problem
- **Description**: Philosophers alternate between thinking and eating, sharing forks placed between them.
- **Solution**:
  - Use semaphores to represent forks.
  - **Pseudocode**:
    ```
    semaphore forks[5] = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1};

    Philosopher(i):
      wait(forks[i]);
      wait(forks[(i+1)%5]);
      eat();
      signal(forks[i]);
      signal(forks[(i+1)%5]);
    ```
- **Challenges**: Avoiding deadlocks by ordering resource acquisition or introducing a host.

#### Readers-Writers Problem
- **Description**: Ensures multiple readers can access a resource simultaneously, but writers need exclusive access.
- **Solution**:
  - **First Readers-Writers Problem**: Prioritizes readers.
  - **Second Readers-Writers Problem**: Prioritizes writers.
  - **Pseudocode for Writer Priority**:
    ```
    semaphore mutex = 1, write = 1;
    int readcount = 0;

    Reader:
      wait(mutex);
      readcount++;
      if (readcount == 1)
          wait(write);
      signal(mutex);
      read();
      wait(mutex);
      readcount--;
      if (readcount == 0)
          signal(write);
      signal(mutex);

    Writer:
      wait(write);
      write();
      signal(write);
    ```
