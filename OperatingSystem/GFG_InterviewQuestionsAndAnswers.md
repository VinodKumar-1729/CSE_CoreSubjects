1. **What is a process and process table?**
   - A process is an instance of a program in execution, such as a web browser or a command prompt. The operating system manages processes and allocates resources like CPU time, memory, and disk space to them. To track processes, the OS maintains a **process table**, which contains information about each process, including its resources and current state.

2. **What are the different states of a process?**
   - A process can be in one of three states:
     - **Running:** The process is using the CPU.
     - **Ready:** The process is waiting for CPU allocation.
     - **Waiting:** The process is waiting for an external event (e.g., I/O).
   - The ready and waiting states are managed as queues.

3. **What is a thread?**
   - A thread is the smallest unit of a process that can run independently. Threads share the process’s memory and resources but have their own program counter, register set, and stack. They are also called lightweight processes and enable parallelism within an application.

4. **What are the differences between a process and a thread?**
   - A **process** is an independent program in execution, while a **thread** is a subset of a process.
   - Threads share the same address space and resources, while processes are independent.
