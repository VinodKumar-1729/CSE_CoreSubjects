  3. **Resolve the Issue**:
     - Optimize the code causing high usage.
     - Kill or restart the problematic process if necessary.

#### **6. How does the OS handle memory leaks?**

- **Memory Leak Handling**:
  1. **Detection**:
     - Tools like `valgrind`, `gperftools`, or `top` to monitor memory usage.
  2. **Action**:
     - Periodically reclaim unused memory using garbage collection (if supported).
     - Notify developers to fix the code causing the leak.
  3. **Prevention**:
     - Employ coding practices such as proper deallocation (`free`, `delete`).

#### **7. Explain how containerization (e.g., Docker) interacts with the underlying operating system.**

- **Containerization**:
  - Containers share the host OS kernel but are isolated using namespaces (process, network, file system).
  - Cgroups manage resource allocation (CPU, memory).

- **Key Interactions**:
  1. **File System**: Uses union file systems (e.g., OverlayFS) to share and isolate files.
  2. **Networking**: Provides virtual networks (bridges, overlays) for containers.
  3. **Process Management**: Containers run as processes in the host OS but are isolated.

#### **8. What are the security challenges faced by operating systems in multi-user environments?**

- **Challenges**:
  1. **Unauthorized Access**: Multiple users increase the risk of privilege escalation.
  2. **Data Isolation**: Ensuring one user's data is not accessible to another.
  3. **Resource Contention**: Preventing denial-of-service attacks by resource-hogging users.
  4. **Malware**: Ensuring processes cannot harm the system or other users.

- **Solutions**:
  - Implementing **access control mechanisms** (e.g., ACLs).
  - Using **sandboxing** and **mandatory access control** (e.g., SELinux).

#### **9. Describe a real-world example where virtual memory significantly improved performance.**

- **Example**: 
  - Large applications like video editing software or databases exceed physical RAM.
  - Virtual memory allows these applications to use disk storage as additional memory, enabling them to run efficiently without upgrading hardware.

#### **10. How would you design an OS for a real-time application like a pacemaker?**

- **Key Design Principles**:
  1. **Deterministic Scheduling**: Ensure tasks meet strict deadlines.
  2. **Fault Tolerance**: Redundancy to recover from hardware/software failures.
  3. **Low Latency**: Minimize response time for critical operations.
  4. **Minimal Overhead**: Lightweight design to maximize performance.

- **Implementation**:
  - Use a **hard real-time OS** like FreeRTOS or VxWorks.
  - Implement **priority-based preemptive scheduling** for critical tasks.
