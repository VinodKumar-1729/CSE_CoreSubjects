### **CPU Scheduling**  

CPU scheduling is a critical part of operating systems that determines which process gets the CPU when multiple processes are in the ready queue. Here's a comprehensive breakdown of the requested topics:

---

### **1. Scheduling Algorithms**

#### **a. First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**
- **Description**: Processes are scheduled in the order of their arrival.
- **Implementation**: Uses a FIFO queue.
- **Advantages**:
  - Simple to implement.
  - Non-preemptive, reducing overhead.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - **Convoy Effect**: Long processes delay shorter ones.
  - Poor average waiting time if burst times vary significantly.
- **Use Case**: Best for batch systems where turnaround time is not critical.

#### **b. Shortest Job First (SJF)**
- **Description**: Selects the process with the shortest burst time next.
- **Types**:
  - **Non-Preemptive**: Once a process starts, it runs to completion.
  - **Preemptive (Shortest Remaining Time First - SRTF)**: Preempts the current process if a new process with a shorter burst time arrives.
- **Advantages**:
  - Minimizes average waiting time.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Requires prior knowledge of burst times.
  - Starvation for longer processes.
- **Use Case**: Useful in systems where job lengths can be estimated.

#### **c. Priority Scheduling**
- **Description**: Each process is assigned a priority, and the CPU is allocated to the process with the highest priority.
- **Types**:
  - **Preemptive**: Higher-priority processes can preempt running ones.
  - **Non-Preemptive**: Processes with higher priority are selected from the ready queue after the current process finishes.
- **Advantages**:
  - Flexible for handling time-critical tasks.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Starvation of low-priority processes (**Solution**: Aging).
- **Use Case**: Real-time systems and time-critical tasks.

#### **d. Round Robin (RR)**
- **Description**: Processes are executed in a cyclic order with a fixed time quantum.
- **Implementation**: Uses a circular queue.
- **Advantages**:
  - Fair allocation of CPU time.
  - Preemption ensures responsiveness.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Performance depends on the choice of time quantum:
    - Too small: High overhead due to frequent context switches.
    - Too large: Behaves like FCFS.
- **Use Case**: Time-sharing systems.

#### **e. Multilevel Queue Scheduling**
- **Description**: Processes are divided into multiple queues based on priority or type (foreground, background, etc.). Each queue can have its own scheduling algorithm.
- **Advantages**:
  - Segregation allows specialized handling of different process types.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Fixed queue assignments can lead to inefficiency.
- **Use Case**: Systems with diverse types of processes.

#### **f. Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling**
- **Description**: Processes can move between queues based on behavior or execution time.
- **Advantages**:
  - Highly flexible and responsive.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Complex to implement and configure.
- **Use Case**: General-purpose operating systems.

### **2. Performance Metrics**

#### **a. Throughput**
- **Definition**: The number of processes completed per unit of time.
- **Importance**: Higher throughput indicates better system performance.

#### **b. Waiting Time**
- **Definition**: Total time a process spends in the ready queue waiting for CPU.
- **Formula**:
  \[
  \text{Waiting Time} = \text{Turnaround Time} - \text{Burst Time}
  \]
- **Goal**: Minimize waiting time for better user experience.

#### **c. Turnaround Time**
- **Definition**: Total time taken from process arrival to its completion.
- **Formula**:
  \[
  \text{Turnaround Time} = \text{Completion Time} - \text{Arrival Time}
  \]
- **Importance**: Lower turnaround time means faster execution of processes.

#### **d. Response Time**
- **Definition**: Time between a process's arrival in the ready queue and the first time it starts execution.
- **Importance**: Critical for interactive systems.

### **3. Comparisons of Algorithms**

| **Algorithm**         | **Preemptive** | **Fairness**         | **Starvation** | **Best For**               |
|------------------------|----------------|----------------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| **FCFS**              | No             | Poor (Convoy Effect) | No             | Batch systems              |
| **SJF**               | SRTF: Yes      | Poor                 | Yes            | Systems with predictable jobs |
| **Priority Scheduling**| Both           | Depends on Aging     | Yes            | Real-time systems          |
| **Round Robin**       | Yes            | High (Fair Allocation)| No             | Time-sharing systems       |
| **Multilevel Queue**  | Both           | Depends on Design    | Yes            | Mixed system environments  |
| **Multilevel Feedback Queue** | Yes    | High                 | No             | General-purpose systems    |

### **4. Key Points**
1. **FCFS** is simple but inefficient for varying burst times.
2. **SJF** is optimal for average waiting time but impractical for unknown burst times.
3. **Round Robin** ensures fairness but can suffer from overhead due to context switching.
4. **Priority Scheduling** requires careful handling of starvation using aging.
5. **Multilevel Feedback Queue** is the most flexible but complex to configure.
