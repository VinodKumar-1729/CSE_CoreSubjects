   - **View**: Displays data to the user.
   - **Controller**: Handles user input and updates the Model and View accordingly.

5. **What are the building blocks of React?**
   The main building blocks of React are:
   - **Components**: Reusable pieces of code that render HTML.
   - **JSX**: JavaScript XML for writing HTML in React.
   - **Props and State**: Props are data passed to components; State is data managed within a component.
   - **Context**: Shares data between components without passing props manually.
   - **Virtual DOM**: A lightweight representation of the real DOM that enhances performance.

6. **What is Replication in MongoDB?**
   Replication creates multiple copies of data across servers to improve data availability, enable distributed read operations, and ensure backup and disaster recovery. These copies are called replica sets.

   - **LOOP**: Repeat the process until terminated (e.g., Ctrl+C).

15. **What is a Callback in Node.js?**
   A callback is a function executed after an asynchronous operation completes. For example, when reading a file, Node.js starts the operation and moves to the next task, executing the callback once the file is read.

16. **What are Pure Components in React?**
   Pure components are React components that implement `shouldComponentUpdate` to optimize rendering. They re-render only if their props or state change.

17. **How does Node.js handle child threads?**
   Node.js runs as a single-threaded process but can use child threads for tasks like asynchronous I/O. These threads operate in the background, ensuring the main thread remains non-blocking.

18. **What are some features of MongoDB?**

   Prop drilling occurs when data is passed from a parent component to deeply nested child components through multiple intermediary components.

20. **How do you manage packages in a Node.js project?**
   Packages are managed using tools like npm or Yarn. Dependency versions are tracked in `package.json` and `package-lock.json` to ensure consistency across environments.

1. **What is JSX in React JS?**
   JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. It enables React components to define their structure and behavior in a readable way. JSX allows embedding JavaScript expressions within curly braces, making it more dynamic. After compilation, JSX is converted into standard JavaScript objects.

2. **How to handle routing in Express JS?**
   Express.js handles routing using the `express.Router()` method. This method creates a modular router object that allows defining multiple routes for an application. Each route specifies a path and a handler function.

3. **What is the virtual DOM in React?**
   The virtual DOM is a lightweight JavaScript representation of the real DOM. React uses it to improve rendering performance. When changes occur, React compares the new virtual DOM with the old one and updates only the parts that have changed in the real DOM.

4. **What is middleware in Node.js and how is it used?**
   Middleware in Node.js is a function that processes requests and responses. It is used for tasks like authentication, logging, or error handling. Middleware functions can modify the request or response objects and determine the next steps in the app’s request-response cycle.

5. **What is a RESTful API?**
   A RESTful API is a web API design that uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD operations on resources. RESTful APIs are stateless, meaning each request contains all the information needed to process it.

6. **Explain the event loop in Node.js.**
   The event loop in Node.js enables asynchronous programming. It operates on a single thread, managing multiple tasks by queuing and executing them in order. This allows non-blocking I/O operations while maintaining concurrency.

7. **What are Node.js streams?**
   Streams in Node.js handle continuous data flow efficiently. Types of streams include:
   - Writable: Write data (e.g., `fs.createWriteStream()`).
   - Readable: Read data (e.g., `fs.createReadStream()`).
   - Duplex: Both readable and writable (e.g., `net.Socket`).
   - Transform: Modify data while reading and writing (e.g., `zlib.createDeflate()`).

8. **What are Node.js buffers?**
   Buffers in Node.js store binary data temporarily, enabling efficient handling of streams. Buffers have a fixed size and provide additional features like encoding support.

9. **Why use Express.js over Node.js?**
   Express.js simplifies backend development with features like routing and middleware, reducing boilerplate code. It integrates well with Node.js for building scalable web applications.

10. **What is MongoDB?**
    MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like documents with optional schemas. It supports scalability and provides features like indexing, aggregation, and geospatial queries.

11. **What is a collection in MongoDB?**
    A collection in MongoDB is a group of documents. It is similar to a table in relational databases but supports dynamic schemas, allowing documents with different structures.

12. **Explain the term “Indexing” in MongoDB.**
    Indexing in MongoDB improves query performance by creating a data structure that stores field values in an organized manner. It reduces the time taken to retrieve specific data from large datasets.

13. **What are forms in React?**
    Forms in React allow user interaction and data input. They include elements like text fields, buttons, checkboxes, and radio buttons. Forms are used for tasks like authentication and search functionality.

14. **Explain the lifecycle methods of components in React.**
    - `getInitialState()`: Initializes component state.
    - `componentDidMount()`: Executes after the component is added to the DOM.
    - `shouldComponentUpdate()`: Decides if a component should re-render.
    - `componentDidUpdate()`: Runs after the component updates.
    - `componentWillUnmount()`: Executes before removing a component.

15. **What is Redux?**
    Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications. It centralizes application state and uses actions and reducers to manage state changes predictably.

16. **What are the components of Redux?**
    - **Store**: Holds the application state.
    - **Action**: Represents an event or intent to change the state.
    - **Reducer**: Determines how the state changes in response to actions.

17. **What is React Router?**
    React Router is a library for managing navigation in React applications. It allows defining routes to create a single-page application with multiple views.

18. **Why do we need React Router?**
    React Router enables:
    - Consistent structure and behavior.
    - Navigation between multiple views in a single-page application.

19. **What is the difference between ShadowDOM and VirtualDOM?**
    - **ShadowDOM**: Encapsulates HTML and CSS for isolation.
    - **VirtualDOM**: A lightweight representation of the DOM used by React for efficient updates.

20. **Is Node.js entirely single-threaded?**
    No, Node.js uses a single thread for JavaScript execution but employs multiple threads for non-blocking I/O operations through its event loop.

21. **What do you mean by Temporal Dead Zone in ES6?**
    The Temporal Dead Zone is the phase where `let` or `const` variables are declared but not initialized. Accessing these variables during this phase results in a reference error.

22. **How to connect Node.js to a MongoDB database?**
    Use the `mongodb` or `mongoose` library in Node.js to connect to MongoDB. For example:
    ```javascript
    const mongoose = require('mongoose');
    mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/mydb', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });
    ```

23. **How to connect Node.js with React.js?**
    To connect Node.js and React.js:
    - Use Node.js as the backend API server.
    - Fetch data in React using `fetch` or `axios`.
    - Serve the React app and API on the same or different ports.

24. **Can you elaborate on the MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline?**
    The MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline processes and transforms data using sequential stages like `$match`, `$group`, `$project`, and `$sort`. Each stage refines the data before passing it to the next stage.

25. **How can you use the `like` operator to query MongoDB?**
    Use the `$regex` operator for pattern matching. For example:
    ```javascript
    db.collection.find({ name: { $regex: /^Nick/ } });
    ```

26. **Name a few techniques to optimize React app performance.**
    - Use `React.memo` for memoization.
    - Implement code splitting and lazy loading.
    - Avoid unnecessary re-renders using `shouldComponentUpdate`.
    - Optimize lists with virtualization libraries like `react-virtualized`.

27. **What is the purpose of `module.exports`?**
    `module.exports` allows exporting functions, objects, or variables from a Node.js module so they can be used in other files using the `require` statement.

28. **Can you explain CORS?**
    CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a mechanism that allows web applications to access resources from different origins while ensuring security through specific HTTP headers.

29. **What is DOM diffing?**
    DOM diffing compares the new virtual DOM with the previous one to identify changes. React updates only the affected parts of the real DOM, improving performance.
