### Most Widely Used SDLC Model

**Agile** is the most widely used SDLC model due to its adaptability, customer-centric approach, and ability to handle changes effectively. Below are key reasons for its popularity:

1. **Adaptability to Change:** Agile embraces changes even late in the development process, making it suitable for dynamic environments.
2. **Customer Satisfaction:** Frequent deliveries and continuous customer involvement ensure alignment with client expectations.
3. **Faster Time-to-Market:** Agile’s iterative cycles enable rapid delivery of working software.
4. **Risk Management:** Regular feedback and testing help identify and mitigate risks early.
5. **Collaboration:** Agile fosters cross-functional collaboration, enhancing communication and teamwork.
6. **Continuous Improvement:** Retrospectives encourage teams to reflect and optimize processes continuously.
7. **Incremental Delivery:** Agile allows stakeholders to see tangible progress with each iteration, improving transparency.

### Hybrid Approaches
In practice, many organizations adopt **hybrid models** that combine elements of different SDLC methodologies. These tailored approaches leverage the strengths of multiple models to address specific project needs. For example:

- **Agile-Waterfall:** Used for projects requiring structured phases but also need flexibility in later stages.
- **Spiral-Agile:** Combines risk-driven development with Agile’s iterative delivery.

Choosing the right model or hybrid approach requires careful evaluation of the project’s objectives, constraints, and team capabilities.
