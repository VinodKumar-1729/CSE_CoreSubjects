### 1. **What is cloud computing? Explain with examples.**
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more over the internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. Instead of owning their own computing infrastructure or data centers, companies can rent access to anything from applications to storage from a cloud service provider.

**Example:**
- **Google Drive:** Allows users to store files and access them from anywhere.
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS):** Provides services like hosting websites, running applications, or storing large amounts of data.

---

### 2. **What are the key features of cloud computing?**
- **On-Demand Self-Service:** Users can access computing resources as needed without human intervention.
- **Broad Network Access:** Resources are available over the network and can be accessed using standard devices like laptops or smartphones.
- **Resource Pooling:** Cloud providers pool resources to serve multiple users through a multi-tenant model.
- **Rapid Elasticity:** Resources can be scaled up or down automatically based on demand.
- **Measured Service:** Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resources and charge based on usage (pay-as-you-go model).
- **Security:** Data is protected through encryption and other security measures.

---

### 3. **What are the different types of cloud computing models?**
- **Public Cloud:** Services are offered over the internet and shared among multiple organizations. (Example: AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud)
- **Private Cloud:** Services are used exclusively by a single organization, often hosted on-premises or by a third-party provider. (Example: VMware)
- **Hybrid Cloud:** Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. (Example: A company using AWS for scalability and a private cloud for sensitive data)
- **Community Cloud:** Shared among organizations with similar requirements, such as government agencies or research institutions.

---

### 4. **What are the major service models in cloud computing (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)? Provide examples.**
- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Users manage the operating system, applications, and middleware, while the provider manages hardware and networking.  
  **Example:** Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine.
  
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** Offers a platform and environment for developers to build applications without worrying about underlying infrastructure.  
  **Example:** Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure App Service.
