**7. How does email work?**  
Emails are sent via SMTP protocol, stored on a server, and delivered using POP/IMAP protocols. If delivery fails, the email may be queued or returned as undelivered.  

---

**8. What is the difference between active and passive cyberattacks?**  
- **Active Attack**: Modifies system resources or data (e.g., data tampering). Victim is notified.  
- **Passive Attack**: Observes or copies data without modifying it (e.g., eavesdropping). Victim is not notified.  

---

**9. What is a social engineering attack?**  
Manipulating individuals to reveal information or take actions beneficial to the attacker, often through deception.  

---

**10. Who are black hat hackers and white hat hackers?**  
- **White Hat Hackers**: Ethical hackers who find and fix security gaps.  
- **Black Hat Hackers**: Malicious hackers who exploit systems for personal gain.  

---

**11. Define encryption and decryption.**  
- **Encryption**: Converting plaintext into ciphertext to secure data.  
- **Decryption**: Reversing ciphertext back into plaintext for readability.  

---

**12. What is the difference between plaintext and cleartext?**  
- **Plaintext**: Unencrypted text intended to be encrypted.  
- **Cleartext**: Text stored or transmitted without encryption, never intended to be encrypted.  

---

**13. What is a block cipher?**  
A block cipher encrypts plaintext in fixed-size blocks (e.g., 64-bit) using modes like ECB (Electronic Code Book) or CBC (Cipher Block Chaining).  

---

**14. What is the CIA triangle?**  
The CIA Triad ensures information security through:  
- **Confidentiality**: Protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access.  
- **Integrity**: Ensuring data accuracy and consistency.  
- **Availability**: Ensuring resources are accessible when needed.  

---

**15. What is the Three-Way Handshake?**  
A process used by TCP to establish a reliable connection using three steps:  
- **SYN**: Sender requests connection.  
- **SYN-ACK**: Receiver acknowledges the request.  
- **ACK**: Sender confirms acknowledgment.  

**Cybersecurity Notes in Question and Answer Format**

1. **How can identity theft be prevented?**
   - Use strong passwords and avoid sharing PINs.
   - Enable two-factor authentication for email.
   - Protect devices with passwords.
   - Avoid installing untrusted software.
   - Refrain from posting confidential information on social media.
   - Verify the authenticity of payment gateways before entering passwords.
   - Regularly change your PINs and passwords.
   - Avoid giving personal information over the phone.

2. **What are some common hashing functions?**
   - Division Method
   - Mid Square Method
   - Folding Method
   - Multiplication Method

3. **What is two-factor authentication?**
   - Two-factor authentication uses two independent methods for secure access. It enhances security by requiring two layers of verification, such as a password and a one-time code.

4. **What does XSS stand for? How can it be prevented?**
   - XSS stands for Cross-Site Scripting. It’s a web vulnerability that lets attackers execute scripts in users’ browsers.
   - Prevention:
     - Filter user inputs upon entry.
     - Encode outputs to prevent script execution.
     - Use appropriate response headers.
     - Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP).

5. **What is shoulder surfing?**
   - Shoulder surfing occurs when an attacker observes your screen or keyboard to steal personal information, like passwords.

6. **What is the difference between hashing and encryption?**
   - **Hashing:** Converts data into fixed-length keys. Irreversible.
   - **Encryption:** Encodes data to keep it secret. Reversible if you have the decryption key.

7. **What is the difference between information security and information assurance?**
   - **Information Security:** Protects information from unauthorized access and ensures confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
   - **Information Assurance:** Focuses on managing risks and ensuring data integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation.

8. **What is the difference between HTTPS and SSL?**
   - **HTTPS:** Secure version of HTTP using SSL/TLS for encryption.
   - **SSL:** Cryptographic protocol used with HTTP to encrypt data. Replaced by TLS.

9. **What is system hardening?**
   - System hardening reduces the attack surface by securing configurations, removing vulnerabilities, and improving robustness.

10. **What is the difference between phishing and spear phishing?**
    - **Phishing:** General email attacks targeting multiple users.
    - **Spear Phishing:** Targeted email attacks aimed at specific individuals or organizations.

11. **What is Perfect Forward Secrecy?**
    - Encryption method that generates a new session key for every user action, ensuring previous communications remain secure even if a key is compromised.

12. **How to prevent Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks?**
    - Use strong WEP/WAP encryption.
    - Set strong router login credentials.
    - Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN).

13. **What is ransomware?**
    - Malware that encrypts user data and demands a ransom for decryption.

14. **What is Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)?**
    - Governing authority for digital certificates ensuring secure communication. It uses public-private key pairs for security.

15. **What is spoofing?**
    - Spoofing is pretending to be someone else to steal information or compromise security.
    - Types:
      - **IP Spoofing:** Manipulating IP addresses to intercept communication.
      - **ARP Spoofing:** Redirecting network traffic to a hacker.
      - **Email Spoofing:** Sending fake emails to steal sensitive data.
