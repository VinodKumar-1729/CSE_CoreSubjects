## **4. Normalization and Database Design**

### **1. What is Normalization in DBMS?**
**Definition:**  
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

**Purpose:**  
- Eliminates duplicate data.  
- Ensures data dependencies are logically stored.  
- Reduces data anomalies (insertion, update, deletion anomalies).  

**Example:**  
If a table contains repeated customer information for every order, normalization helps break it into separate tables (Customer and Orders) with relationships.

---

### **2. Why Do We Need Normalization?**
**Purpose:**  
- To minimize redundancy and avoid unnecessary storage.  
- To prevent inconsistencies in data.  
- To ensure that relationships between tables remain accurate.  
- To improve database efficiency and integrity.  

**What Happens If It Is Not Used?**  
- Data duplication leads to wasted storage.  
- Anomalies arise (inconsistent data after updates or deletions).  
- Query performance might degrade due to excessive data duplication.  

---

### **3. What Are the Different Normal Forms?**  
- **1NF (First Normal Form)** - Eliminates duplicate columns, ensures atomic values.  
- **2NF (Second Normal Form)** - Removes partial dependencies (if the table has a composite primary key).  
- **3NF (Third Normal Form)** - Eliminates transitive dependencies.  
- **BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)** - Strengthened 3NF to handle special cases.  
- **4NF (Fourth Normal Form)** - Deals with multi-valued dependencies.  
- **5NF (Fifth Normal Form)** - Breaks down further to avoid redundancy.

| StudentID | StudentName | Department | HOD |  
|-----------|------------|------------|-----|  

ðŸ”´ **Not in 3NF** (HOD depends on Department, not StudentID).  
âœ… **3NF Format:**  
- Split into Student (StudentID, StudentName, Department) and Department (Department, HOD).  

---

### **7. What is BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)?**

|-----------|---------|------------|  

ðŸ”´ **Not in BCNF** (A professor may teach multiple subjects, but Subject determines Department).  
âœ… **BCNF Format:**  
- Break into separate tables for Professors and Subject-Department mapping.  

---

### **8. What is 4NF and 5NF?**
