**ER Model**

---

### **1. ER Model (Entity-Relationship Model)**
The ER Model is a high-level conceptual data model that is used to define the structure of a database in terms of entities, attributes, and relationships. It provides a graphical representation of data and is often used during the database design phase.

#### **Key Components of the ER Model:**
- **Entities:**
  An entity is an object or thing in the real world that can be identified distinctly.
  - **Entity Types:** The collection of entities with the same attributes (e.g., Student, Employee).
  - **Entity Instances:** Individual instances of an entity type (e.g., a specific student named Vinod Kumar).

- **Attributes:**
  Attributes are the properties or characteristics of an entity.
  - **Simple Attributes:** Cannot be divided further (e.g., Name, Age).
  - **Composite Attributes:** Can be divided into smaller sub-parts (e.g., Full Name â†’ First Name + Last Name).
  - **Derived Attributes:** Can be derived from other attributes (e.g., Age derived from Date of Birth).
  - **Multivalued Attributes:** Can have multiple values for a single entity (e.g., Phone Numbers).

- **Relationships:**
  Relationships define how entities are related to each other.
  - **Degree of a Relationship:**
    - Unary (1 entity type), Binary (2 entity types), Ternary (3 entity types).
  - **Cardinality:**
    - One-to-One (1:1), One-to-Many (1:N), Many-to-Many (M:N).

- **Keys:**
  Keys uniquely identify an entity within an entity set.
  - **Primary Key:** Unique identifier for an entity.
  - **Candidate Key:** Set of attributes that can uniquely identify an entity.
  - **Foreign Key:** Used to establish relationships between entities.

#### **Weak Entity and Strong Entity:**
- **Strong Entity:**
  - Can exist independently of other entities.
  - Has a primary key.
- **Weak Entity:**
  - Cannot exist without being associated with a strong entity.
  - Does not have a primary key and relies on a **discriminator** or **partial key**.
  - Identified through a **strong-weak relationship** (depicted by a double diamond).

#### **Diagram Example:**
```
[Student] -- (EnrolledIn) -- [Course]
[Student] = Entity, (EnrolledIn) = Relationship, [Course] = Entity
Attributes: Student_ID (Primary Key), Name, Age; Course_ID (Primary Key), Title.
```

### **2. Converting ER Diagram to Relational Schema**
1. **Entities:**
   - Convert each strong entity into a table.
   - Attributes of the entity become columns.

2. **Relationships:**
   - For **1:1 relationships**, combine the entities into one table or use foreign keys.
   - For **1:N relationships**, include the primary key of the "1" side as a foreign key in the "N" side.
   - For **M:N relationships**, create a separate table for the relationship with foreign keys referencing the primary keys of the related entities.

3. **Weak Entities:**
   - Create a table for the weak entity.
   - Include the discriminator and primary key of the associated strong entity as part of the composite primary key.

Example:
- ER Diagram: [Student] -- (Takes) -- [Course]
- Relational Schema:
  - `Student(Student_ID, Name, Age)`
  - `Course(Course_ID, Title)`
  - `Takes(Student_ID, Course_ID)`

### **3. Relational Model**
The Relational Model organizes data into tables called **relations**.

#### **Key Concepts:**
- **Relation:** A table with rows and columns.
- **Tuple:** A single row in a table.
- **Attribute:** A column in a table.
- **Domain:** The set of permissible values for an attribute.
- **Keys in the Relational Model:**
  - **Primary Key:** Unique identifier for tuples.
  - **Candidate Key:** Potential primary keys.
  - **Foreign Key:** Used to establish relationships.

Example:
- Relation: `Student`
  - Attributes: `Student_ID`, `Name`, `Age`.
  - Tuples:
    - (1, "Vinod", 22)
    - (2, "Ravi", 21)

### **4. Comparison of Hierarchical, Network, and Relational Models**
| Feature              | Hierarchical Model         | Network Model                 | Relational Model               |
|----------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Structure**        | Tree-like hierarchy        | Graph-like structure          | Tables                         |
| **Relationships**    | Parent-child (1:N)         | Many-to-Many (M:N)            | Keys and foreign keys          |
| **Data Retrieval**   | Navigational (via paths)   | Navigational (via pointers)   | Declarative (via SQL queries)  |
| **Ease of Use**      | Complex for large systems  | Moderately complex            | Simple and user-friendly       |
| **Flexibility**      | Limited                    | Moderate                      | Highly flexible                |
| **Examples**         | IMS (IBM)                 | CODASYL                       | Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL      |
