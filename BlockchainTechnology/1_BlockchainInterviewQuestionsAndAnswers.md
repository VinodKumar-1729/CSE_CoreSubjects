**1. What is Blockchain Technology?**  
Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that records transactions across multiple computers in a secure and tamper-proof manner. It ensures transparency, security, and immutability by using cryptographic techniques.  

---

**2. What are the key features of Blockchain?**  
- **Decentralization**: No central authority; data is shared across nodes.  
- **Immutability**: Once recorded, data cannot be altered or deleted.  
- **Transparency**: Transactions are visible to all participants in the network.  
- **Security**: Cryptographic techniques ensure data integrity.  
- **Distributed Ledger**: Data is replicated across all nodes in the network.  
- **Consensus Mechanisms**: Transactions are validated through mechanisms like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS).  

---

**3. Explain how Blockchain works.**  
- Transactions are initiated by users.  
- These transactions are grouped into a block.  
- A consensus mechanism validates the block.  
- The validated block is added to the existing Blockchain.  
- Once added, the block becomes a permanent part of the ledger, visible to all network participants.  

---

**4. What is a block in a Blockchain?**  
A block is a digital container that holds a group of transactions. It consists of:  
- **Header**: Includes metadata like timestamp, hash of the previous block, and a nonce.  
- **Body**: Contains the actual transaction data.  

---

**5. What is a distributed ledger?**  
A distributed ledger is a database spread across multiple locations or nodes. It allows all participants in the network to access, verify, and update records simultaneously without needing a central authority.
